# TerraCells
### A Dead Cells inspired Terraria mod
Currently in alpha build stage.

### For Playtesters
Please keep in mind that nothing in this build is finalized. It's likely that the balancing may be off, some features may be annoyingly buggy, and that
the mod may become unplayable for various reasons. We hope to fix any issues as such that may arise as we figure out the early pain points of development.

Please do not create duplicate reports for bugs by checking if any have already been created. If one exists, you can instead upvote it to 
help determine where prioritization is needed.

You can report bugs on Discord in [#bug-reports](https://discord.com/channels/1260223010728706169/1315830991926984764)
